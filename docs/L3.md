# L3 Cache
The L3 cache is a direct mapped cache designed to handle system-wide memory accesses, and connects to the memory subsystem of the chip.
Rather than having a direct connection to the memory subsystem, the L3 cache connects multiple cores together in order to provide a NUMA memory subsystem. This avoid some of the large hardware associated with switching systems for many-core processors. This NUMA design does however slow down memory accesses occuring accross thread blocks, meaning any RTOS associated with the GPU must account for this potential performance bump.
